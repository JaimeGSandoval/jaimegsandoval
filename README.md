## About Me :smile:

Coding has become my life. If I go a day without coding it feels odd, and that's mainly because it's such a big part me. I truly enjoy using the combination of imagination and logic to create something new and useful for people. I'd love to bring my skills to a company and I look forward to being part of a dev team! Let's collab and make something great :thumbsup:
