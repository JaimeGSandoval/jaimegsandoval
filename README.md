## About Me :smile:
 Coding has become my life. If I go a day without coding it feels odd, and that's mainly because it's such a big part of my everyday experience. I truly enjoy using the combination of imagination and logic to create something new and useful for people, or to just try to figure something out with the skills I've aquired. I wasn't always involed with tech, but I took the plunge at the suggestion of a softball teammate, to whom I'm forever grateful towards for introducing me to this field.  I'd love to bring my skills to a team and look forward to being part of a dev team!
